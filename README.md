Risk board game invasion dice roll.

In the board game Risk, when a territory is invaded, the results of the battle are determined by rolling up to 6 dice, depending on the number of attacking units and defending units.

The attacking army can use up to (attacking units - 1) dice, with a maximum of 3 dice.
The defending army can use as many dice as the total units defending, with a maximum of 3 dice.

The dice rolls of both armies are compared one by one, from highest roll to lowest.
The defending dice rolls have an advantage, as if the dice roll is a tie, then the defending dice win.

Each army loses units based on each dice roll lost, for a maximum loss of 3 units per roll.
